# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data-Coursera_project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in Coursera.

The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

#Files
The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.
getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip must be unzipped.
Then copy UCI HAR Dataset folder into the working directory where run_analysis.R file is present. 

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and transformations that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. This R code can be launched in RStudio by just importing this file.

The output of the 5th step is called tidy_data_set.txt. It is space separated in case you want to view it in Microsoft Excel.
